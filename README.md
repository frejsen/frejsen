Hey, I'm Frejsen or Frej! I'm a 15 year old student, who's learning programming outside of school.
I'm currently doing the CS50 introductory class from Havard and plan to get into C/C++ afterwards.

I plan to get into web design/game development later on, but I have no fixed vision at all, and I wouldn't doubt it if I completely changed my path later on! :)
